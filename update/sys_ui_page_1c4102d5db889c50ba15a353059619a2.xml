	<h1>DataSilos - WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE</h1>
	<p>Welcome to DataSilos.<!-- - created and maintained by&#160;<a href="mailto:sascha.wildgrube@servicenow.com">Sascha Wildgrube</a>.--></p>
	<p>The DataSilos application helps to separate data between different organisational units - so called&#160;<b>data silos</b>.</p>
	<p>In contrast to domain separation DataSilos allows the exchange of data (in form of individual records) between data silos and makes them visible to users on a need-to-know basis.</p>
	<h2>Use DataSilos if</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Domain Separation is too strict</li>
		<li>Domain Separation is already implemented for a different purpose and more detailed visibilty rules must be enforced WITHIN a domain</li> 
		<li>There is a certain level of collaboration taking place between organizational units</li>
		<li>Visibility of individual records can be defined by a user's assignment to groups</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Do NOT use DataSilos if</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The different organizational units shall NEVER exchange any records (in that case Domain Separation may be considered)</li>
		<li>Visibility of data should be controlled by specific user roles</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Supported processes</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Incident</li>
		<li>Change Request</li>
		<li>Problem</li>
		<li>Service Catalog Requests (not the Catalog itself)</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>How DataSilos controls record visibility</h2>
	<p>Users are members of groups. Groups can be associated to data silos by a silo manager. Each association between a group and a data silo has a type. Whether an individual user can see a record of a supported process depends on the type of their group's association with a silo.</p>
	<p><b>Member:</b>&#160;Users in groups that are associated to a silo as type "Member" can only see those records that are or were directly assigned to that group.</p>
	<p><b>Fulfiller:</b>&#160;Users in groups that are associated to a silo as type "Fulfiller" can see all records that have been initialily assigned groups that are associated to the same silo. And they see all records that have ever been assigned directly assigned to their group. As a result fulfillers have an overview of all work that originates from the same silo. However fulfillers do not see any records that have been created in another silo and assigned to another team within the fulfiller's silo.</p>
	<p><b>Supervisor:</b>&#160;Users in groups that are associated to a silo as type "Supervisor" can see all records that have ever been assigned to any group of the same silo. As a result supervisors have an overview of all work originating and/or that is conducted in their silos. This includes all records that have been created in other silos and that have been assigned to the supervisor's silo.</p>

	<h2>System Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Madrid or later</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/saschawildgrube/servicenow-devtools/" target="_blank">DevTools 1.3.0</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Roles</h2>
	<p>DataSilos supports the following roles:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos.admin</b>&#160;A user that has access to all DataSilo administration and configuration modules. Includes the&#160;<b>x_snc_datasilos.manager</b>&#160;role.</li>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos.manager</b>&#160;A user that can configure data silos and assign groups to data silos.</li>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos.sentinel</b>&#160;A user that is NOT impacted by any filtering by DataSilos. This is suitable for users that should have global access (e.g. for reporting) or technical users (for integrations).</li>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos.ghost</b>&#160;A user that can create and modify records without impacting the whitelist.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Configuration Options</h2>
	<ul>
	<g2:evaluate var="jvar_strProperties" jelly="true">
		var HtmlEncode = x_snc_devtools.HtmlEncode;
		var grSP = new GlideRecord('sys_properties');
		grSP.addQuery('sys_scope','=','dafbffebdbb78450ba15a353059619eb');
		grSP.orderBy('name');
		grSP.query();

		var strProperties = '';
		while (grSP.next())
		{
			var strDescription = HtmlEncode(grSP.getValue('description'));
		strProperties = strProperties + '<li><b>'+grSP.getValue('name')+'</b>&#160;'+strDescription+'</li>';
		}
		strProperties;	
	</g2:evaluate>
	<g2:no_escape>$[jvar_strProperties]</g2:no_escape>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Column Fields</h2>
	<p>Each supported table is equipped with a number of new column fields:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos_group_whitelist</b>&#160;The group whitelist field stores a list of groups which should have access to the record.</li>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos_supervisor_whitelist</b>&#160;The supervisor whitelist field stores a list of data silos. The users in the supervisor groups within the data silos will be able to access the record.</li>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos_global</b>&#160;The global visibility flag controls if this record should be globally visible - i.e. it can be seen by all users without any exception. This flag can be useful to make very important incidents public to everyone.</li>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos_ghost</b>&#160;The ghost flag controls if the record's whitelists should be updated. If set to false, whitelists are populated. If the ghost flag is true, whitelists remain unchanged. This allows custom implementations to control the whitelist population. If this flag is set to true, the record behaves in the same way as if it was changed by a user with the x_snc_datasilos.ghost role.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Implementation guide</h2>
	<h3>Analysis</h3>
	<p>The following aspects and topics should be considered when implementing the DataSilos application:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Who should have which role?</li>
		<li>Who should be responsible to maintain the silo configuration? Which processes might be affected? What happens if new groups are being created today?</li>
		<li>Who is responsible to define the data silos and can provide a mapping to groups? In large organizations this might be a challenging task - especially if there are multiple systems of record from which organization data is retrieved and imported into the ServiceNow instance.</li>
		<li>Are there any before/query business rules that serve comparable purposes? Should they be replaced?</li>
		<li>Are there any customized ACLs in place?</li>
		<li>Are there any records in supported tables that do not have an assignment groups - and hence may be invisible to most users?</li>
		<li>Which integrations exist and how will (or should) they be impacted? Keep in mind that technical users used for integrations will also be affected by access restrictions applied by DataSilos.</li>
		<li>Is Performance Analytics being used? What impact on reporting is expected?</li>
		<li>What reports are maintained and run and by whom?</li>
		<li>Does the existing group structure support the later silo configuration? Are groups missing? Are there duplicated?</li>
		<li>Which users are assigned to multiple groups and will that result in expected and intended bahaviour?</li>
		<li>Should data silo configuration be automated - maybe as part of existing processes that integration organizational data into the platform?</li>
		<li>How should external suppliers and vendors be affected? The specific rights and roles of users associated to external suppliers and vendors should be considered.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Preparing Validation</h3>
	<p>The following spects should be considered for testing and validation:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>DataSilos modifies queries being sent to the database in order to implement the visibility filtering. These modifications come at a performance cost. Depending on how many teams (and silos) a user is a member of and depending on hw many records are in the table, the performance impact might be visible to users. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO PERFORM A REALISTIC LOAD TEST! A simulation of actual user behaviour in an production-like instance with production-like configuration can show if the performance impact is acceptable.</li>
		<li>It is recommended to identify pages and views that are most frequently used by users - both for automated and manual user acceptance testing.</li> 
		<li>Functional test cases should proof that specific records are visible to specific user groups AND that other records are explicitly NOT visible to other user groups.</li>
		<li>Functional test cases should cover scenarios in which records are passed from one silo to another.</li>
		<li>Any existing test cases (that relate to the supported tables) should be executed as part of the QA. Behaviour that was expected in the past may no longer be working with active filtering. In some cases the silo configuration might have to be reviewed, in other cases, the test cases might have to be updated.</li> 
	</ol>
	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Install the DataSilos application. If you see this installation guide within the ServiceNow instance, you did this already. You can fork this&#160;<a href="https://github.com/saschawildgrube/servicenow-datasilos" target="_blank">repository</a>&#160;and then import the application from source control.</li>
		<li>Install the DevTools application. You can fork this&#160;<a href="https://github.com/saschawildgrube/servicenow-devtools" target="_blank">repository</a>&#160;and then import the application from source control.</li>
		<li>Check the DevTools version. If a different (more recent) version of DevTools was imported from source control you must create a branch based on the corresponding version tag and switch to that branch.</li>
		<li>Follow the installation instruction contained in DevTools/Start.</li>
		<li>Elevate roles to security_admin</li>
		<li>Go to "Access Control (ACL)" and check if there are any ACLs in the "DataSilos" application scope that refer to OOTB tables (e.g. incident, incident_task, etc.) with a name like e.g. incient.* (This is "incident DOT asterix"). If you see some, they must be deleted. Do NOT delete any ACLs that refer to any x_snc_datasilos* fields (like e.g. x_snc_datasilos_group_whitelist). A platform bug eventually creates them during installation and associates them to the app scope. Note that they cannot be deleted directly, because the platform denies any change to an ACL that refers to a table in the global scope from within an application scope. Use the following trick: Change the table to "Data Silos" then "Save" and then "Delete" them.</li>
		<li>Switch to global scope</li>
		<li>For each of the following tables peform the steps listed below:</li>
		<pre>
incident
incident_task
change_request
change_task
problem
problem_task
sc_request
sc_req_item
sc_task
sysapproval_approver (ONLY add the business rule, NOT the ACL in this case)
		</pre>
		<ol>
			<li>Switch to the GLOBAL scope.</li>
			<li>Add a new business rule for the table.</li>
			<li>Configure the business rule as follows (replace "table_name" by the corresponding table listed above):</li>
			<pre>
Name: "DataSilos - table_name"
When: before
Insert: true
Update: true
Query: true
			</pre>
			<li>Add the following script:</li>
			<pre>
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
	x_snc_datasilos.ExecuteBusinessRule(current, previous);
})(current, previous);
			</pre>
			<li>Go to the "Business Rules" module and verify the new business rule is active and in the global scope.</li>
			<li>Verify you are still in the GLOBAL scope.</li>
			<li>At least two ACLs for the&#160;<b>read</b>&#160;operation must exist for each table:&#160;<b>table_name</b>&#160;and&#160;<b>table_name.*</b>. Ideally only ONE ACL exists for&#160;<b>table_name</b>&#160;and&#160;<b>table_name.*</b>&#160;(Note it is "table_name DOT asterix") for the&#160;<b>read</b>&#160;operation. You may have to create or change existing ACLs or consolidate multiple ACLs into one. Either way: make sure that all active ACLs contain the following script logic.</li> 
			<li>Activate 'Advanced' (if not active already) and add the following script or combine it with already existing scripts:
			<pre>
answer = x_snc_datasilos.ExecuteACL(current);	
			</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
			CAUTION: setting the response variable "answer" sometimes only works ONCE during a script. To avoid any issues it is recommended to set the "answer" value only once at the end of the script.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Install any additional customer specific applications that are based on DataSilos and extend its functionality.</li>
		<li>If possible activate the DataSilos app in the options and then go to "Test Suite" and execute all tests. Fix any issues reported by the tests. If needed deactivate the DataSilos app after running all tests.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Configuration</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Assign the x_snc_datasilos.manager role to users who are tasked to configure the silos.</li>
		<li>As a data silos manager go to the "Data Silos" module and configure all data silos. Add the corresponding groups to each data silo. Groups associated to a data silo are either&#160;<b>Member</b>,&#160;<b>Fulfiller</b>&#160;or&#160;<b>Supervisor</b>&#160;groups. This can also be done automatically or via data import.</li>
		<li>Assign the x_snc_datasilos.sentinel role to technical users where applicable. They will not be affected by any filtering.</li>
		<li>Assign the x_snc_datasilos.sentinel role to users who are tasked to create reports and hence must access all data where applicable.</li>
		<li>Configure additional fields for tables that should be used to populate the whitelist.</li>
		<li>Go to "Scheduled Jobs" and define the frequency in which the "Maintenance" scheduled script should run. Experience shows that the script can process approx. 1000 records per minute - so plan your roll-out procedure accordingly.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Activation</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the "Options" module and activate the DataSilos application.</li>
		<li>Deactivate any existing conflicting business rules that may have been identified earlier.</li>
		<li>Go to "Test Suite" and execute all tests.</li>
		<li>Go to "Scheduled Jobs" and activate the "Maintenance" scheduled script</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Rollback</h3>
	<p>In case anything goes terribly wrong after activation, follow these steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Activate ATF testing and run all tests (in production!) to verify that the installation and functionality works from the perspective of the DataSilos application.</li>
		<li>Go to the "Options" module and DEACTIVATE the DataSilos application.</li>
		<li>If this does not resolve the issue, deactivate all "DataSilos" business rules and UNDO all changes done to ACLs.</li>
		<li>If this still does not resolve issues - the root cause is probably somewhere else. However, at this point one could remove the DataSilos application as a whole – BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS WILL IRREVOCABLY DELETE ALL WHITELIST INFORMATION!</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<h3>What happens if a user is not associated to any group?</h3>
	<p>The user will only see records that they created (opened_by) or which have been created on their behalf (caller_id). Those users will not see any other records unless that user has the admin role or the x_snc_datasilos.sentinel role.</p>
	<h3>What happens if a record is not associated to any group?</h3>
	<p>Only users who created that record or have the admin role will see this record.</p>
	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	<p>DataSilos adds a new field to all relevant tables that contains a whitelist of groups. A user that is at least member of one of these whitelisted groups may see the record. Business rules in the global scope will alter the query and act on inserts and updates to control visibility and extend the whitelist where appropriate.</p>
	
	<h2>Developer guide</h2>
	<h3>Entry points</h3>
	<p>The DataSilos application is implemented in a number of script includes. Most of which contain a single function. The following script includes (i.e. functions) serve as entry points to the application. All other functions are then called from these entry points:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>ExecuteBusinessRule</li>
		<li>ExecuteACL</li>
		<li>Maintenance</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For a more detailed description refer to the DataSilos API Reference below.</p>

	<h3>Extension of scope</h3> 
	<p>Extending the scope of the DataSilos application essentially means to add the filtering logic to more tables. This may have impact on the applications, views, reports and other components that make use of these tables. So before actually extending the scope of DataSilos consider the following steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Verify if there is a more recent version of DataSilos is available that may already cover the new requirements.</li>
		<li>Get in touch with the author of the DataSilos application and check if there is work in progress on a new version of DataSilos. Maybe development work can be synchronized or knowledge can be shared. It is also possible that some of the analysis work has already been done.</li>
		<li>Identify the specific data that requires protection.</li>
		<li>Map out where the data is coming from: manual input from unsers, integrations?</li>
		<li>Identify the rules to be used to control access.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>After a decision has been made to extend scope of the DataSilos application perform the following steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Identify the affected tables</li>
		<li>Add the group whitelist field to all affected tables! Please note that you MUST adapt the column name after entering the column label!</li>

Reference cascade rule: None (not "--None--"!)
</pre>
		<li>Elevate role to security_admin and add create, write, read and delete Access Controls to the table DataSilos whitelist columns for all affected tables:</li>
<pre>
Name: DataSilos Group Whitelist

<pre>
Type: True/False
Column label: DataSilos Ghost
Column name: x_snc_datasilos_ghost
</pre>
		<li>Elevate role to security_admin and add create, write, read and delete Access Controls to the new field for all affected tables:</li>
<pre>
Name: DataSilos Ghost
Requires role: x_snc_datasilos.manager 
</pre>
		<li>Add new navigation modules to display the new tables</li>
		<li>Configure the DataSilos view for these new modules</li>
		<li>Extend the GetConfigBaseline script include to support all new tables. Use the existing table configurations as templates.</li>

DataSilos - incident_task - cross-silo
			</pre>
		<li>Update THIS documentation</li>
		<li>Test the new feature against all known existing use cases related to the added tables.</li> 
	</ol>
	<h2>Release Notes</h2>
	<h3>2.0.0 - WORK IN PROGRESS</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>WARNING: The property x_snc_datasilos.incident.whitelist_trigger_fields has essentially be renamed to x_snc_datasilos.tables.incident.columns.whitelist_trigger.sys_user_group! Make sure to redo the configuration during upgrade!</li>
		<li>WARNING: The property x_snc_datasilos.active now controls the filter ONLY. It will no longer halt the population of the whitelists. As a result it can now be more effectively used as an ON/OFF switch while preparing a go-live or during trouble shooting - without any negative impact on the whitelists of records that are changed in the meantime.</li>
		<li>WARNING: It is now required to configure ACLs not only for&#160;<b>table_name.*</b>,&#160;but also for&#160;<b>table_name</b>,&#160;. Updated the "ACLs" module and tests accordingly.</li>
		<li>DevTools version 1.3.0 or higher is required.</li>
		<li>Introduced the supervisor datasilo whitelist field to enable silo based whitelists for supervisors.</li>
		<li>Introduced the global visibility flag for all tables.</li>
		<li>Introduced the ghost flag for all tables. If set to true whitelists are not updated when a record is changed.</li>
		<li>Introduced configurable group filter. An encoded query can now be configured to control which groups should be considered for whitelist population.</li>
		<li>Introduced the option to avoid expensive queries. When the system property x_snc_datasilos.tables.<b>table_name</b>.avoid_expensive_queries is set to true, queries that do not contain a filter for active records are not altered. This results in users seeing a message that some records have been filtered from the result set and eventually empty result pages.</li>
		<li>The test "DataSilos - incident - cross-silo" now impersonates a user of the current assignment group before re-assigning the incident. This change was made to consider strict customer-specific customizations.</li>
		<li>A number of script includes have been opened up for use from different scopes to enable implementation of customer specific Maintenance() functions and business rules.</li>
		<li>Extended the "Business Rules" module to show all before query business rules for the supported tables.</li> 
		<li>Optimized ExecuteACL() so that it does not evaluate the access restrictions for a single record multiple times.</li>
		<li>Extended the Developer Guide: The DataSilos API Reference has been added and Scope Extention chapter has been refined.</li> 
		<li>Moved all contents from the "Requirement Analysis" chapter into the "Implementation Guide", added process relevant considerations.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>1.4.0 - 2020-07-30</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>DevTools version must be 1.2.1.</li>
		<li>Existence and version of DevTools is now checked in ATF "DataSilos - installation".</li>
		<li>Introduced the global visibility flag for the incident table. If set to true, everyone can see this particular record.</li>
		<li>Reactivated the "Log" module.</li>
		<li>The module "Maintenance" has been replaced by the "Scheduled Jobs" module and shows all scheduled script executions where the name contains "DataSilos".</li>
		<li>The module "Business rules" now shows all business rules that contain "DataSilos" in their name - this is to consider customer's naming conventions with prefixes.</li>
		<li>A bug in the Madrid release caused issues in some navigation modules preventing pre-defined filters to work properly. This has been fixed.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>1.3.0 - 2020-07-16</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Introduced the configurable whitelist_trigger_field option. By setting the table specific option (e.g. x_snc_datasilos.incident.whitelist_trigger_field) the fields that should be used to populate the whitelist can be explicitly configured. If the option is empty the default for each table based on the task table is the assignment_group field. However any other field that contains a reference to a group can be used. Dot-walking is NOT yet supported, though.</li> 
		<li>Introduced the maintenance.log_frequency option to control how often the maintenance script should log the current progress.</li>
		<li>Deactivated the Log module for the time being.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>1.2.2 - 2020-07-15</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>The Maintenance script now explicitly checks the related tables, too. So *task records which are not associated to other whitelisted records are now whitelisted based on their assignment groups.</li>
		<li>Improved logging in the Maintenance script: Only the start and the end of the execution (with a consolidated summary) is logged.</li> 
		<li>Extended the developer guide with more details.</li>
		<li>Added the "Rollback" section to the implementation guide.</li>
		<li>Added a navigation module to show all silo to group associations.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>1.2.1 - 2020-07-08</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Users can now access request items where the associated request is opened on their behalf.</li>
		<li>Fixed issues on access rights to the admin and management navigation modules.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>1.2.0 - 2020-07-07</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Added support for Service Catalog Requests.</li>
		<li>Restructured the installation guide. It is now an implementation guide covering analysis, installation, configuration and the verification phase.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>1.1.3 - 2020-07-06</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Related items (e.g. problem_task) did not apply the whitelist to their parents when created. This has been fixed.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>1.1.2 - 2020-07-04</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Added modules to show all supported tables with the fields relevant for visibility - a useful treat for data silo managers and developers.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>1.1.1 - 2020-07-04</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Extended "DataSilos - Installation" test to check if all business rules and ACLs have been set up correctly.</li>
		<li>Updated developer guide to update the "DataSilos - Installation" test.</li>
